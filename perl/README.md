**FAQ PART**

**Why (not) Python?**

Personally, I don't like Python but I must admit that the community is extremely well organized (even better than the Perl community),
Python nowadays is a top language for the CyberSecurity (and it is used also in more field, one simple example is the artificial intelligence), online a big software part is made with Python and there is almost anything about Perl, remember that Perl has the same potentialities of every normal programming language,one day I asked to myself:

"Why don't try to do something usefull with Perl?" and I decided to merge those 2 my passions.

**how can I contribute?**

If you want to become a contributor please, start contacting me on <Baseband@cpan.org>

**what I can't do with this module?**

In general, the Lorcon2 library offers an huge set of functionalities for crafting frames, injecting them into the network, sniffing from multiple interfaces in real-time and processing the received frames, obviously you shouldn't completely rely only in this library, for a detailed list of all Perl's sugested libraries, please see the homonymous section.

**how am I supposed to use this library?**

"The author declines every responsability from any illegal use of this software"

This phrase is almost ubiquitous in ourdays but can help to understand the possible illegal issues that you can encounter while using this library __improperly__ 

**can I effectively break the latest wireless security protocols using this library?**

No, the entire _Air::Toolkit_ is designed for a more in-dept type of wireless-security assurance, it is suggested mainly for security practicioner and **not** for the casual users, if you think that is possible to crack WPA/WPA2 in few seconds with an old smartphone please, change interests.

**how can I donate?**

The paypal address for a donation is:


Every donation will be used **only** for buying hardware and for test other implementation of the __Air::Toolkit__.

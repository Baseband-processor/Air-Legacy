Made by Edoardo Mantovani, 2020

- increase the functions coverage of lorcon2 (almost done)
- fix many compilation problems at "make" command (+99% success)

REALTODO:
- write full documentation ( 75% )
- write small pdf about every module with the help of community
- fix some C code wich still crash
- decide if static linking lorcon2.so perl's object, this will be a first pass for creating an independing Air::Lorcon2 library (from originary lorcon2)
- try to re-implement CCFLAGS from Makefile.PL

/*
- implement new drivers
   * ath5k 
   * ath9k
   * airo
   * iwlwifi (it will be very difficult)
   * mt76
   * rt2x00
   * ti
  */
  
- add TKIP/CCMP support
- speed up Air::Lorcon2's execution
- rename the entire project into Air::Legacy, this because it will include reaver, aircrack, hashcat and lorcon2 functions

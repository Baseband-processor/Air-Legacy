Made by Edoardo Mantovani, 2020

- increase the functions coverage of lorcon2 (almost done)
- include libnl building for a more low level coverage (?)
- fix many compilation problems at "make" command (+90% success)

REALTODO:
- write full documentation
- write small pdf about every module with the help of community
